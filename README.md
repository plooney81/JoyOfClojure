# Joy

* This repo houses code written while working through the book "The Joy of Clojure" by Micael Fogus and Chris Houser.
* If you are interested in their book, you can find it [here](https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-clojure-second-edition)

## From the Beginning

* Started off learning about different types of collections, including Lists (which you know are pretty important in Lisp), Vectors, Maps, and Sets.

### Lessons Learned

* Clojure does not consider any empty collection to be nil
```clojure
;List
(nil? ()) ;=> false
; Vector
(nil? []) ;=> false
; Map
(nil? {}) ;=> false
; Set
(nil? #{}) ;=> false
```
